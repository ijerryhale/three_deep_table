This project was really just a test bed I used in order to figure out how to create a UITableView in iOS which had some of the functionality of a standard MacOS NSOutlineView.

I have created another repository, 'controller_embed'. This sample demonstrates how to push and pop three different UIViewControllers. The 'controller_embed' repository incorporates all of the functionality of this 'three_deep_table' sample, and the code is more recent.

I have deleted the 'controller_embed' repository in favor of the 'movies' repository. the movies app contains all of the controller_embed app. the movies app is very fluid as I am still adding stuff in to it from another application.

Change design to use UITableView Sections. Will use this code for movies app when it's done.
